# Code-Refactor
Code Refactor for marketing website

## Project requirements:
### Add HTML Semantic elements to the code:
list of HTML semantic elements I replaced DIV's with"
 * Header
 * NAV
 * section
 * main
 * article
 * aside
 * footer
###  elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning: 
The elements in the code are now following a logical order by the sections and semantic elements. 

### Add accessible alt attributes:
all relevant images have a description in the ALT attribute including the hero image where I removed it from the background to position it as an img HTML in the hero section element to add an alt attribute. 

### heading attributes fall in sequential order:
Added meta tags to describe the website and added keywords and scale meta tags, then added the link to the style sheet.

 ### descriptive title : 
Changed the title of the webpage too - Horiseon - Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.

### Application's links all function correctly:
fixed the links in the main navigation bar

### Application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow the semantic structure:
Combined the repetitive code in the style sheet, and placed them in the same order as the HTML page with comments to recognize each section to make it easier for the next person to make any changes.

 ### Application's CSS file is properly commented:
Added comments to the CSS file to separate every section styling and placed all the general styling at the top of the document.

### Application deployed at live URL : 
Application is live on my github in this link - https://phonix375.github.io/Code-Refactor/


### Application loads with no errors:
added a favicon to resolve the error when the application is loaded.


### GitHub repository that contains application code:
git@github.com:phonix375/Code-Refactor.git
